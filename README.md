# Trivia
This is a small project built in one night to learn about socket.io, and develop a game for my friends to play when at my house.
It runs on a node.js server and a react client, it retrieves the trivia questions from https://opentdb.com/ a open source triva question api.
If you plan to connect to it on a seperate device on the network you need to enter the computers ip followed by the correct tcp port. 
( 192.168.1.255:3000 ) example.

This project is still in its alpha stages and I plan to continue working on it in the future.
